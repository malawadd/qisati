Maya stared at her laptop screen, the cursor blinking mockingly in the empty document. Three years of corporate life had drained her creativity, leaving her with nothing but spreadsheets and meeting notes.

The notification sound broke her concentration. Another Slack message from her manager about the quarterly reports. She closed the laptop with more force than necessary.

"That's it," she whispered to her empty apartment. "I'm done."

The decision came suddenly, but it felt like she'd been building toward it for months. She opened her laptop again, this time navigating to a different kind of documentâ€”her resignation letter.

## The Plan

Within hours, Maya had outlined her escape:

1. Quit her job (obviously)
2. Sell everything she couldn't carry
3. Buy a one-way ticket to Bali
4. Figure out the rest later

It wasn't the most detailed plan, but it was hers. For the first time in years, she felt truly alive.

The apartment that had felt like a prison now buzzed with possibility. Every item she looked at fell into one of two categories: essential or excess. The excess pile grew quickly.

Her phone buzzed. A text from her best friend Emma: "Coffee tomorrow?"

Maya smiled as she typed back: "Can't. I'm becoming a digital nomad."

The three dots appeared and disappeared several times before Emma's response came: "What?!"

Maya laughed out loud. This was going to be interesting.`,
