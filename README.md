# Qisati: Read. Collect. Own.

Qisati is a revolutionary platform designed to empower storytellers and engage readers in entirely new ways. We bridge the world of creative writing with cutting-edge blockchain technology, allowing authors to monetize their work directly and readers to truly own the stories they love.

## ‚ú® Main Functionality

Qisati offers a comprehensive ecosystem for digital storytelling:

*   **Discover & Read**: Explore a diverse collection of stories, from captivating fanfictions to original literary works.
*   **Collect & Own**: Acquire limited editions of chapters and series as digital assets, giving you true ownership and a direct stake in your favorite authors' success.
*   **Create & Publish**: Authors can easily write, edit, and publish their stories, controlling their content and earning directly from their audience.
*   **Immersive Audio Dramas**: Transform written narratives into engaging audio experiences with AI-powered voice generation.
*   **Creator Coins**: Launch your own digital currency for your series, fostering a direct connection with your community and unlocking new monetization avenues.

## üéß Audio Drama from Fanfictions: Bringing Stories to Life

Imagine your favorite fanfiction not just as text, but as an immersive audio drama, complete with distinct character voices. Qisati makes this a reality. We leverage advanced AI text-to-speech technology to convert your written dialogue into high-quality audio segments. Authors can assign unique voices to their characters, adding a new dimension to their storytelling and providing an unparalleled listening experience for their readers.

This feature transforms passive reading into active listening, making stories more accessible and engaging. It's a powerful tool for authors to expand their reach and for readers to experience narratives in a richer, more dynamic format.

**Implementation Highlights:**
*   **Frontend for Audio Generation**: `src/components/editor/AudioGenerationPanel.tsx`
*   **Backend Audio Processing**: `convex/generateAudio.ts`

## ü™ô Zora & Creator Coins: Empowering the New Creator Economy

At the heart of Qisati's monetization model is the integration with the Zora Network, a Layer 2 blockchain optimized for the creator economy. Zora empowers creators by enabling them to mint, own, and trade their content seamlessly, removing traditional middlemen and fostering direct engagement with their audience. [1, 2, 3, 7]

With Qisati, authors can launch their own **Creator Coins** for their series. These are digital assets that represent a direct stake in the author's work and community. [4] When readers buy these coins, they directly support the author, and the value of the coin can grow with the popularity and engagement around the series. This creates a new, transparent, and community-driven economic model where both creators and their supporters can benefit. [5, 6, 8, 9]

**Key Benefits of Creator Coins:**
*   **Direct Monetization**: Authors earn directly from their community without intermediaries. [6, 7]
*   **Community Building**: Fans can signal support and share in the upside of a creator's growth. [4]
*   **True Ownership**: Digital assets are owned on-chain, providing transparency and control. [7]
*   **New Business Models**: Enables innovative ways for creators to fund their work and engage with their audience. [1]

**Implementation Highlights:**
*   **Launching Creator Coins**: `src/components/editor/LaunchCoinButton.tsx`
*   **Backend Minting Logic**: `convex/mintChapter.ts`
*   **Displaying Coin Information**: `src/components/coin/CoinTradingDetails.tsx`, `src/components/coin/TradingScreen.tsx`
